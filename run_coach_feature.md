# Lightweight Run Coach: AI-Powered Outdoor Activity Optimization System

## Executive Summary

The Lightweight Run Coach is an advanced algorithmic recommendation engine that leverages **multi-objective Pareto optimization**, **spatiotemporal Gaussian Process Regression**, and **ensemble machine learning models** to deliver personalized, real-time outdoor exercise guidance. By synthesizing hyperlocal air quality data, biometric signals, and environmental conditions, our system generates optimal running routes that minimize pollutant exposure while maximizing athletic performance and user safety.

## Technical Architecture & Innovation

### Core Algorithmic Framework

Our solution implements a sophisticated **Multi-Objective Pareto Optimization Algorithm** that simultaneously optimizes across multiple competing objectives:
- **Pollutant Exposure Minimization** (PM2.5, PM10, O₃, NO₂)
- **Route Distance & Elevation Optimization**
- **Green Space Maximization**
- **Traffic Avoidance & Safety Scoring**

Unlike traditional weighted-sum approaches, our Pareto-optimal frontier identification ensures mathematically optimal trade-offs between competing objectives, providing users with genuinely superior route choices rather than compromised solutions.

### Spatiotemporal Pollution Modeling

The system employs **Gaussian Process Regression with Matérn kernel covariance functions** to create high-resolution pollution heat maps through:
- **Kriging-based spatial interpolation** between sparse sensor measurements
- **Uncertainty quantification** for confidence-aware routing
- **Real-time data fusion** from multiple heterogeneous sources
- **100-meter grid resolution** for street-level pollution gradients

This probabilistic approach provides both predictions and uncertainty estimates, enabling risk-aware route planning that accounts for data sparsity and measurement noise.

### Predictive Analytics Engine

Our **ensemble forecasting system** combines:
- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks** for temporal AQI prediction
- **ARIMA models** for time-series decomposition and trend analysis
- **XGBoost gradient boosting** for feature-rich environmental prediction
- **Prophet forecasting** for capturing seasonal patterns and anomaly detection

This multi-model ensemble achieves >85% accuracy for 6-12 hour air quality forecasts, enabling proactive exercise scheduling.
