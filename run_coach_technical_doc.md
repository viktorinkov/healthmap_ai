# Lightweight Run Coach - Implementation Document

## 1. Executive Summary

The Lightweight Run Coach is an intelligent outdoor activity recommendation system that analyzes real-time air quality, weather conditions, and personal health metrics to suggest optimal running routes, timing, and duration. This feature addresses the IDSO Air Quality & Lung Health Challenge by providing personalized, actionable guidance for safe outdoor exercise.

## 4. Algorithm Design

### 4.1 Multi-Objective Route Optimization Algorithm

The core algorithm combines several optimization techniques:

```python
class RunCoachOptimizer:
    """
    Multi-objective optimization for running routes considering:
    - Air quality exposure minimization
    - Distance/duration preferences
    - Elevation gain constraints
    - Traffic/safety factors
    """
    
    def optimize_route(self, start_point, user_profile, constraints):
        # 1. Generate candidate routes
        candidate_routes = self.generate_route_candidates(
            start_point, 
            radius=constraints['max_distance'] * 0.7
        )
        
        # 2. Calculate exposure scores for each route
        for route in candidate_routes:
            route['aqi_exposure'] = self.calculate_route_exposure(
                route, 
                self.get_pollution_grid()
            )
            route['elevation_gain'] = self.calculate_elevation(route)
            route['green_space_ratio'] = self.calculate_green_coverage(route)
            
        # 3. Apply Pareto optimization
        pareto_front = self.find_pareto_optimal_routes(
            candidate_routes,
            objectives=['aqi_exposure', 'distance', 'elevation_gain']
        )
        
        # 4. Personalized ranking
        best_route = self.rank_by_user_preferences(
            pareto_front, 
            user_profile
        )
        
        return best_route
```

### 4.2 Pollution Exposure Model

**Spatiotemporal Interpolation Using Gaussian Process Regression**:
- Combines official monitoring stations with crowdsourced data
- Accounts for wind patterns, traffic density, and topography
- Updates in real-time as new data arrives

```python
class PollutionGrid:
    def __init__(self, resolution_meters=100):
        self.resolution = resolution_meters
        self.gp_model = GaussianProcessRegressor(
            kernel=Matern(length_scale=500, nu=1.5),
            alpha=1e-6
        )
    
    def interpolate_pollution(self, sensor_data, grid_points):
        # Kriging interpolation for spatial pollution field
        X_train = sensor_data[['lat', 'lon']]
        y_train = sensor_data['pm25']
        
        self.gp_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
        predictions, uncertainty = self.gp_model.predict(
            grid_points, 
            return_std=True
        )
        
        return predictions, uncertainty
```

### 4.3 Time Window Optimization

**Predictive Modeling for Air Quality Forecasting**:
- LSTM network for short-term (6-12 hour) AQI prediction
- Ensemble with ARIMA for robustness
- Incorporates weather forecast data

```python
def find_optimal_time_window(location, duration_minutes, lookahead_hours=12):
    # Get forecasted AQI for next N hours
    forecast = predict_aqi_timeseries(location, lookahead_hours)
    
    # Find continuous windows meeting safety threshold
    safe_windows = identify_safe_periods(
        forecast, 
        threshold=user_aqi_threshold,
        min_duration=duration_minutes
    )
    
    # Rank by additional factors
    ranked_windows = rank_time_windows(
        safe_windows,
        factors=['temperature', 'humidity', 'uv_index', 'wind_speed']
    )
    
    return ranked_windows[:3]  # Top 3 recommendations
```

### 4.4 Personalized Health Risk Assessment

**Adaptive Threshold Calculation**:
```python
class HealthRiskCalculator:
    def calculate_personal_threshold(self, user_profile):
        base_aqi_limit = 100  # Moderate level
        
        # Adjust based on health conditions
        if user_profile.has_asthma:
            base_aqi_limit *= 0.6
        if user_profile.has_copd:
            base_aqi_limit *= 0.5
        if user_profile.is_pregnant:
            base_aqi_limit *= 0.7
            
        # Adjust based on fitness level (from Strava data)
        fitness_multiplier = self.calculate_fitness_factor(
            user_profile.vo2_max,
            user_profile.resting_hr
        )
        
        # Adjust based on recent HRV trends
        hrv_adjustment = self.calculate_hrv_factor(
            user_profile.recent_hrv_data
        )
        
        return base_aqi_limit * fitness_multiplier * hrv_adjustment
```

## 5. Advanced Features

### 5.3 Machine Learning Pipeline

    'avg_pm25', 'max_pm25', 'distance_km', 'elevation_gain',
    'green_space_pct', 'traffic_density', 'time_of_day',
    'user_fitness_level', 'user_sensitivity_score'
]

model = XGBRegressor(
    objective='reg:squarederror',
    n_estimators=200,
    max_depth=6,
    learning_rate=0.1
)
```
